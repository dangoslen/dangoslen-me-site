          <h3>Are you trying to build a great software team?</h3>

          <p>Building great software teams is tricky. Whether it's a team you manage or a team you are on, there are lots of ingredients to get right.</p>

          <p>But when we <i>do</i> get it right, a great software team is seemingly unstoppable.</p>
          
          <p><b>Yet we only focus on individual growth instead of team growth.</b></p>
          
          <p>This newsletter is meant to give you some tools and tips on how to build your team. After a decade in the industry, I've seen how the wrong person can destroy a team, the right challenge can motivate one, and the incredible power of focusing on team success over individual success.</p>
