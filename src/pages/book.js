          <h2>Code Review Champion - The Power of Getting Code Reviews Right</h2>
          <p>One of my favorite topics is that of <a href="/tags/code-reviews">code reviews</a>. I think that when applied correctly code reviews can be the <i>best</i> way to level-up your entire team.</p>
          <p>Yet, code reviews continue to be a point of contention in our industry. Some teams have adopted code reviews really well and others have nearly outlawed them. Other teams think they "should" do reviews, but they treat them as a formality or a rubber-stamp.</p>
          <p>But we have great data that show code reviews work. So what is the gap?</p>
          <p><b>I believe it's because many engineers weren't taught how to actually effectively review code.</b></p>
          <p>Even more so, many teams don't know how to manage the process to know if they are actually getting value or if they are just rubber-stamping code.</p>
          <p>I'm writing a book to help engineers and teams do just that - build the skills neccesary to be code review champions!</p>
          <p>Below is what I'm hoping to write about. It's still in the works, so I'd <i>love</i> your <a href="">feedback!</a>.</p>
