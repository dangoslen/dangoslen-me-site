                {" "}Hi, I'm Dan.
              </Greeting>
              <p>I'm a software engineer with over 10 years experience. I've worked with monotholic database applications, micro-services, and everything in between. While I've done full-stack development before, I've recently focused primarliy on writing RESTful web-services systems deployed into Kubernetes environments.</p>
              <p>In my short career, I've worked for small companies ({"<"} 20 employees), large companies ({">"} 50,000) and a few medium ones too. And what I have found is that at <b>all</b> of these compnaies, developers are <b>tired and burned out.</b> They never feel like they can learn enough, code quick enough, or keep quality high enough.</p>
              <p>I want to help fix that problem.</p>
              <p><b>I'm trying to help developers become the best they can through sustainable development practices.</b> Even with software engineering being a young field, we know enough to know simply asking developers to code hard or longer doesn't work.</p>
              <p>I hope I can share the learnings and hopes I have gained from my own experience to others, including you.</p>
              <p>Happy coding!</p>
