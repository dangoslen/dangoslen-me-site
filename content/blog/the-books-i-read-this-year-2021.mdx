Every year I try to take a short inventory of the books I read through that year. I find that doing so helps me solidify the concrete things I learned from each. You can see [last year's list](dangoslen.me/blog/the-books-i-read-2020) too if you would like.

Let's jump right in.

<BookReview title="Dune" author="Frank Herbert" link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune" coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1555447414l/44767458.jpg">

After hearing the hype about the upcoming movie and some positive reviews from friends I decided to pick up this (almost) classic. I was surprinsgly dissapointed. While I really like the premise of the book and the environmental angle it took, I felt like the main character continues to be seeminlgy more powerful every second. Nothing can stop him it seems - and he doesn't need help from others. New pieces of lore are created on every page to explain some additional way that our hero evades failure. To me, a great story requires failures - or at least a cost - from our hero. I wouldn't recommend the book.

<BookReview title="Write Useful Books" author="Rob Fitzpatrick" link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58482658-write-useful-books" coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1625372113l/58482658._SY475_.jpg">

I haven't _technically_ finished this book yet. The reason being that _Write Useful Books_ is written much more like a guide through a process rather than something you read, think about, and apply. In particualr, I like Rob's push to invovle potential readers as early as possible - something the Agile-ists would appreciate. So far I've found it really helpful on the book I'm working on :)

<BookReview title="The Book on Rental Property Investing"
  author="Brandon Turner"

Brandon Turner has become the modern real estate investing guru. Being a part of [BiggerPockets](www.biggerpockets.com), he has built a fantastic platform for himself. The book itself is straightforward and extremely helpful. I've been considering how to eventually move into the real estate game (besides my own home) and this was a great primer. The top takeaways from Brandon is a constant reminder of two things 1) you _will_ run into issues to fix and 2) you _need_ to take action; it can be too easy to continue reading and reading without doing anything meaninful towards owning a property. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in real estate investing.

<BookReview title="Building Wealth One House at a Time"
  author="Joshua Schaub"

  coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1348829360l/428082.jpg"

Another book on real estate investing, this book focuses much more on the nitty-gritty of running a real estate investment portfolio. I also appreciated Joshua spending a lot of time on different ways to earn from investing in single family properties: renting, partnerships, and general creativity around how deals can happen. Much more "dry" than Brandon's book above

<BookReview title="Leaders Eat Last"
  author="Simon Sinek"
  link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144853-leaders-eat-last"
  coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1400881733l/16144853.jpg"

Over the past year or so, I've really started to grow in my leadership responsibilities in my career. Simon Sinek has worked with some of the top businesses in the world, so I was eager to dive into a book of his and _Leaders Eat Last_ was the first hit after a Google search. Sinek's main claim is that good leaders need to think about their teams more as a family than as expendable resources. And while I think the current corporate climate is far too much in thinking about people as resources, I do not think we should view our teams as a family. The why is complicated and nuanced, but the core being that my co-workers are _not_ my family; my family is my family. I also found his take to be a tad reductionistic as he distills all human behavior to four different brain chemicals firing in different situations. I didn't find much pratical wisdom here; just a lofty ideal that has some meritcs, but falls short to help leaders grow and lead with confidence.

<BookReview title="Team Topologies"
  author="Matthew Skelton and Manuel Pais"
  link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44135420-team-topologies"
  coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1563409554l/44135420.jpg"
>

_Team Topologies_ is a stand-out book for me this year. I enjoyed a book that focused on _organizational problems_ around software engineering rather than technical problems. I like how the authors focus on helping readers take practical steps towards creating solutions rather than creating an ideal without a lot of steps to get there. They also create several "guides" at the very begginning of the book to help you know what parts of the book might address your partiucular problem. I hope to take some of the thoughts and tools from this book to every team/organization I join. _If you want to read more of my thoughts, check out [my top takeaways]() article._

<BookReview title="Designing Data-Intensive Applications"
  author="Martin Klepman"
  link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23463279-designing-data-intensive-applications"
  coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1415816873l/23463279.jpg"
>

If there ever was a single volume for how to write scalable applications, this would be that book. Methodical and extensive in its approach, Marty walks you through all the problems that arise once we start designing massively distributed systems built to handle extreme loads of data. He starts all the way at files and eventually discusses the CAP theorem, Linearizability, and patterns to help teams building data intensive apps. I also appreciate how Marty refrains from judging any database or technology as _bad_ - he simply points out when those technologies are best suite for the case at hand. I'm planning on re-reading this book again in the future.

<BookReview title="East of Eden"
  author="John Steinbeck"
  link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden"
  coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1639969375l/4406.jpg"
>

I'm a sucker for a good Steinbeck novel. There is something incredible to me in how he creates characters that are both foolish, wise, heroic, and cowardice. _East of Eden_ is not different. We follow essentially three generations of farmers that cross-paths in California all simply trying to make their way in life. Through twists and turns, tragedy and triump, we see how life can truely break people and also how funny it all turns out to be. I always find after reading Steinbeck that I learn nuggest of wisdom about how to live and how to die. Better yet, I enjoy how he shares that wisdom often in one short sentence after chapters of preparing and guiding the reader over pages to see a certain character in a certain way - and to question how we have been judging them that whole time. I hope to re-read this book again in the future.

<BookReview title="The Innovation Biome"
  author="Kumar Mehta"
  link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36629199-the-innovation-biome"
  coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1511177726l/36629199._SY475_.jpg"
>

This short book by Dr. Mehta is a good primer for leaders or managers looking to help their team think about innovation better. _The Innovation Biome_ walks through the neccesary elements needed for innovation to happen and how like an ecological biome, a innovation biome is one in which innovation happens naturally. Everyone within the organization is asking questions, everyone has the ability to offer ideas that **will** be considered, and the process for how ideas grow is structured enough so that ideas don't get forgotten (which I find to be the hardest part). This book might also be a helpful tool for teams considering creating a hackathon, 20%-time, or other structures designed to generate ideas to help them fully captialize on the output of those events.

<BookReview title="Project Hail Mary" 
 author="Andy Weir"
 link="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary"
 coverUrl="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1597695864l/54493401.jpg"
>

I loved _The Martian_ when I read it several years ago and _Hail Mary_ is even better. Andy is just _good_ at digging into the mind of a deeply intelligent, but lonely problem-solver. We follow Dr. Ryland Grace aboard the spaceship _Hail Mary_ as he races to save humanity. Like any problem solver he makes mistakes along the way, but we also see the power of science to overcome obstacle after obstacle. The question is if he can solve all of them to actually save humankind...
