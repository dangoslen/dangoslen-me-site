title: What's the Point of Pull Requests Anyway?
description: Why you should use pull requests to merge changes in your
  repository. Even for personal ones.
---
If you are a beginner in the world of `git` and hosted `git` platforms like GitHub or GitLab, you have probably heard the term "pull request" or "merge request". You also probably don't fully understand what value they bring to your team and why they are used so often in teams.

_sidenote: I'll be using the term "pull request
 in this article, but its effectively the same as a "merge request" in GitLab

Pull requests are the epicenter of modern development.

This is where most continuous integration happens. Where code reviews happen. Where static analysis, performance testing, and other forms of metrics about your code are reported.

This is also where most learning happens! This is where collaboration amongst developers, product owners, and designers can take place effectively.
