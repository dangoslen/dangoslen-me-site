title: What's the Point of Pull Requests Anyway?
description: Why you should use pull requests to merge changes in your
  repository. Even for personal ones.
---
If you are a beginner in the world of `git` and hosted `git` platforms like GitHub or GitLab, you have probably heard the term "pull request" or "merge request" before. You also probably don't fully understand what value they bring to your team and why they are used so often in teams.

*Sidenote: I'll be using the term "pull request
 in this article, but its effectively the same as a "merge request" in GitLab*

Pull requests are actually an extremely useful tool that helps teams build and share software. They do have a bit of a learning curve though, but I believe its worth it. My goal is this article is to help you get familiar with pull requests and how they fit into the flow of building software.

What is a Pull Request?
A pull request is really just a request to pull/integrate changes from one branch to another. It might be from a branch with a single commit from just one developer, or a branch with multiple author's and multiple commits.

How do They Help?

Pull requests are the epicenter of modern development.

This is where most continuous integration happens. Where code reviews happen. Where static analysis, performance testing, and other forms of metrics about your code are reported.

This is also where most learning happens! This is where collaboration amongst developers, product owners, and designers can take place.
