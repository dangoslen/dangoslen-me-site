title: How to Create Great Software Development Teams
description: You can be a part of a great software development team! You just
  need to create it.

As engineers and developers, we tend to work in teams. This is true for both industry jobs and even for open-source projects or side-projects. It's just a truth to accept.

With this in mind, the teams we work with matter. They have an impact on our work, our career, and just about everything.

Even if you are a great engineer, if you work on a generally lousy team, you get "lumped" with that bad team. Perceptions about that team, the failures they have, etc.

The opposite is also true: if you work for a generally good team, their successes, perceptions, etc. will work towards your advantage.

So how do you become a member of a great team? Do you need to change jobs or companies? Do you need to go to Google or Facebook?

Maybe, but maybe not. I want to share my experience working with great teams and what you can do if you want to be part of a great team.

## First - What Makes a Great Team?
This question is one of the most studied questions of the modern era. Google, Spotify, Carnegie Mellon, and many other groups have spent millions of dollars understanding what contributes to making an effective team.

While there are always different findings in this research, a few standout.

## Psychological Safety
The concept of psychological safety has been researched by several groups, including Google's. They spent several years researching what made effective teams so effective across their organization and concluded that safety was the number one trait in common across successful teams.

What does this form of safety mean in the context of a team? For many, it means that they feel safe to express ideas. They aren't afraid of retribution from fellow team members or team leaders if they have a different opinion. They aren't fearful to experiment or to fail.
Put succinctly: when teams have safety, they spend more time solving problems than worrying about internal conflicts or perceptions.

## Learning and Sharing Knowledge
Another aspect of great teams is the concept of learning new things and sharing those learnings with the team. Those that cannot learn new things and then effectively share that knowledge will fail.

Why? Because problems change. As problems change and morph, new techniques or approaches might be needed. If a team cannot learn how to solve these problems, they will become obsolete.

Another reason is that teams change. The team is always losing or gaining members. If members leave and take domain knowledge with them, they will struggle to support their existing responsibilities. Additionally, if a team cannot quickly teach their expertise to new members, they will not prevent new members from contributing.

## What Do These Attributes Look Like?
There are many different behaviors that great software teams might use to create safety and encourage learning. Each one has its quirks and nuances. They might enjoy long discussions to iron out details about an architecture; they might prefer comments on a shared document. They might have a lot of meetings; they might have very few.

You will see, however, a few common behaviors across all great software development teams. Here are just a few.

- Code reviews and pair programming sessions are common
- Members ask for feedback from each other all the time
- When issues or bugs arise, no one plays the "blame game"
- Documentation is kept up to date
- Knowledge is shared openly and routinely
- All team members contribute to the backlog - not just product or architects

This list is, of course, a small one! It is not exhaustive or definitive on the behaviors that a great team has. My own experience is that every great team I have worked with does at least these behaviors.

## How to Create One?
If only it were easy. Building a great team requires a lot of effort, the right people, and time. There isn't a magic formula either since the dynamics are different for each. 

You can start by trying to create these two traits - safety and sharing knowledge - as much as you can. Take the initiative to put together a talk or tutorial on a framework your team is interested in. Make sure everyone on your team has a chance to speak. Contribute your ideas openly and freely. Own up to your own mistakes rather than trying to pass it on to someone else.

If you aren't an outgoing person and those ideas scare you that is ok too! Maybe instead of a talk you suggest all reading a book about development. Perhaps you can start by asking for feedback from others about your own ideas. Simply asking "how can I help you?" to a teammate can do a lot to open up knowledge and building safety.

That was a lot! To summarize, great software is built by great teams. Great teams have common traits that are rooted in safety and sharing knowledge. You can make your current team great (or at least start the process!) by working to create that safety and sharing knowledge yourself first. 

Happy coding! 

_p.s. - I 100% get that many people might be on dysfunctional teams that don't treat each other with respect. I'm not talking about those sorts of teams - they are the opposite of great! It might be the right move for you to leave that team. You don't need to "go down with the ship" trying to turn it around. Feel confident to leave a team like that in search of a better one!_
