title: How to Create Great Software Development Teams
description: You can be a part of a great software development team! You just
  need to create it.
---
As engineers and developers, we tend to work in teams. This is true for both industry jobs and even for open-source projects or side-projects. It's just a truth to accept.

With this in mind, the teams we work with matter. They have an impact on our work, our career, and just about everything.

Even if you are a great engineer, if you work on a generally lousy team, you get "lumped" with that bad team. Perceptions about that team, the failures they have, etc.

The opposite is also true: if you work for a generally good team, their successes, perceptions, etc. will work towards your advantage.

So how do you become a member of a great team? Do you need to change jobs or companies? Do you need to go to Google or Facebook?

Maybe, but maybe not. I want to share my experience working with great teams and what you can do if you want to be part of a great team.

## First - What Makes a Great Team?
This question is one of the most studied questions of the modern era. Google, Spotify, Carnegie Mellon, and many other groups have spent millions of dollars understanding what contributes to making an effective team.

I don't have time to cover all of the findings from this research. Instead, I want to focus on just two core attributes.

## Psychological Safety
The concept of psychological safety has been researched by several groups, including Google's. They spent several years researching what made effective teams so effective across their organization and concluded that safety was the number one trait in common across successful teams.

What does this form of safety mean in the context of a team? For many, it means that they feel safe to express ideas. They aren't afraid of retribution from fellow team members or team leaders if they have a different opinion. They aren't fearful to experiment or to fail.
Put succinctly: when teams have safety, they spend more time solving problems than worrying about internal conflicts or perceptions.

## Learning and Sharing Knowledge
Another aspect of great teams is the concept of learning new things and sharing those learnings with the team. Those that cannot learn new things and then effectively share that knowledge will fail.

Why? Because problems change. As problems change and morph, new techniques or approaches might be needed. If a team cannot learn how to solve these problems, they will become obsolete.

Another reason is that teams change. The team is always losing or gaining members. If members leave and take domain knowledge with them, they will struggle to support their existing responsibilities. Additionally, if a team cannot quickly teach their expertise to new members, they will not prevent new members from contributing.

## What Do These Attributes Look Like?
There are many different behaviors that great software teams might use to create safety and encourage learning. Each one has its quirks and nuances. They might enjoy long discussions to iron out details about an architecture; they might prefer comments on a shared document. They might have a lot of meetings; they might have very few.

However, you will see a few common behaviors across all great software development teams. Here are just a few.

- Code reviews and pair programming are common
- Members ask for feedback from each other daily
- When issues or bugs arise, no one plays the "blame game"
- Documentation is kept up to date
- Knowledge is shared openly and routinely
- Any team member to create a story for the backlog

This list is, of course, a small one! It is not exhaustive or definitive on the behaviors that a great team has. My own experience is that every great team I have worked with does at least these behaviors.
