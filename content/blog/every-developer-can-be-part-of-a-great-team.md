title: Every Developer Can Be Part of a Great Team
description: You can be a part of a great software development team! You just
  need to build it.

As engineers and developers, we tend to work in teams. This is true for both industry jobs and even for open-source projects or side-projects. It's just a truth to accept.

With this in mind, the teams we work on matter. They have impact on our work, our career, and just about everything.

Even if you are a great engineer, if you work on a generally bad team you get "lumped" with that bad team. Perceptions about that team, the failures they have, etc.

The opposite is true as well. If you work for a generally good team, their successes, perceptions, etc. will work towards your advantage. Your own reputation will be boosted too.

So how do you get part of a great team? Do you need to change jobs or companies? Do you need to go to Google or Facebook?

Maybe, but maybe not. I'd like to share my experience working with teams and what you can do to become a part of a great one.
