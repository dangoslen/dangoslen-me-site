title: Every Developer Can Be Part of a Great Team
description: You can be a part of a great software development team! You just
  need to build it.

As engineers and developers, we tend to work in teams. This is true for both industry jobs and even for open-source projects or side-projects. It's just a truth to accept.

With this in mind, the teams we work on matter. They have impact on our work, our career, and just about everything.

Even if you are a great engineer, if you work on a generally bad team you get "lumped" with that bad team. Perceptions about that team, the failures they have, etc.

The opposite is true as well. If you work for a generally good team, their successes, perceptions, etc. will work towards your advantage. Your own reputation will be boosted too.

So how do you get part of a great team? Do you need to change jobs or companies? Do you need to go to Google or Facebook?

Maybe, but maybe not. I'd like to share my experience working with teams and what you can do to become a part of a great one.

## What Makes a Great Team?
This question is one of the most studied questions of the modern era. Google, Spotify, Carnegie Mellon, and many other groups have spent millions of dollars understanding what contributes to making an effective team.

I don't have time to cover all of the findings from this research. Instead, I want to focus on just two core attributes that I find important.

#### Physchological Safety
The concept of psychological safety has been researched by several groups, including Google's. They spent several years researching what made effective teams so effective across their whole org and concluded that safety was the number one trait of an effective team.

What does this form of safety mean in the context of a team? For many it means that they feel safe to express ideas. They aren't afraid of retribution from team members or team leaders to have a different opinion. They aren't fearful to experiment or of failure. 

Put succiently: when team's have safety, they spend more time solving problems than worrying about internal conflicts or perceptions.

#### Learning and Sharing Knowledge
Another aspect of great teams is the concept of learning new things and sharing those learnings with the team. Teams that cannot learn new things and then effectively share that knowledge will fail.

Why? Because problems change. As problems change and morph, new techniques or approaches might be needed. If a team cannot learn how to solve these problems, they will become obsolete.

Another reason is that teams change. The team always is always losing or gaining new team members. If team members leave and take domain knowledge with them, the team will struggle to support their existing responsibilitites. Additionally, if a team cannot quickly teach their knowledge to a new team member, the new team member will struggle to contribute to the team's mission.

## What Does That Look Like on a Development Team? 
There are many different behaviors that great teams might use to create safety and encourage learning. Each team has its own quirks and nuances. They might really enjoy long discussions to iron out details about an architecture instead of comments on a shared document. They might have a lot of meetings or they might have very few. 

Here are some patterns that I have seen great development teams do:

* Code reviews and pair programming are common
* Ask for feedback from each other on a daily basis
* Don't play blame games when a bug is found
* Work to keep documentation up to date
* Share their knowledge openly and routinely 
* Allow any team member to create a story for the backlog

This is, of course, a small list! It is not exhasutive or definitive on the behaviors that a great team has. My own experience is that every great team I have worked with does at least these behaviors.
