Many developers are aware of the power of gamification. From video games to board games to Dungeons and Dragons, there is something powerful about creating a competition or structure around leveling-up or completing challenges.

This idea has even seeped into how we talk about career progression. We talk about level-ing up when we want new skills or are hoping to get promoted. We assign levels across corporations to our roles. 

I've been thinking about this recently as I've been reading a book called [The Power of Moments](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466952-the-power-of-moments). It talks a lot about how we miss out on pivotal moments in our lives, careers, and organizations that with a little bit of effort can increase engagement and happiness.

I'm not going to cover the entire book, but it has left me wondering: what moments in our development teams are we missing out on that would increase out teams' engagement and happiness?

## What are Developer Moments?

The starting question, of course, is: what are developer moments? What are significant moments within a dev team?

It's a great question, and there often few wrong answers. Each developer and team will consider some moments more significant than others. The book recommends thinking through four criteria

* Moments of elevation: a moment that flips the script from the common day
* Moments of pride: a moment of pridefulness of an accomplishment
* Moments of insight: a moment when some new truth or knowledge is suddenly seen and apparent
* Moments of connection: a moment when people come together and share something significant together

For this article, we'll focus (though not exclusively) on moments of pride (significant accomplishment) and connection (when people share a significant moment together). 

Here are some possible ideas:
* A new developers first day on a team
* A developers first feature in production
* A repository the team owns hits 100, 1000, etc. merged pull requests 
* The team finishing an intense project
* A service or system processing it's first request - or millionth!
* First time breaking production (turn a negative experience into a badge of honor)

This is a short list, but I think it get's you started. Once you see a few of these, you'll start seeing opportunities for them everywhere.

## How to Harness These Moments?

Now that we have a list, how do we harness them? How can you properly recognize these moments when the happen?

Again, it will look different for each team. Some teams like the badge idea, some teams like t-shirts, and others like to focus on emoji's in your Slack or Team's channels.

Whatever the format is, the key is you need to _lean_ into it. You can't "sorta" celebrate moments haphazardly; that is what results in last-minute sheet cake retirement "celebrations" in the break room. 

To make these moments truly meaningful, you have to _over_ do it. As the book states

> beware the soul-sucking force of reasonableness

If you try to automate too much, or try to fit it as a quick shout-out in another meeting. All of those ideas sound reasonable, of course, but the rob you and your team for the magic of celebrating such moments. 

## An Example of Harnessing Moments Effectively

A small example of how to harness momements effectively isn't taken from a software team or repo, but by a tool I used called [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) (not an affliate link btw). I've been using Grammarly for a few years, but was has impressed me is how the send me a weekly email that includes milestones I've reached.

For example, I'm on a 44-week writing streak on Grammarly. They let me know each week that I extend that streak, which is a great way to ["not break the chain"](https://todoist.com/inspiration/dont-break-the-chain). They show it in a badge too as oppossed to just basic text.

On top of the writing streak, they track my total word count and told me when I hit 10,000 words and then 500,000 words (!). They also keep track of my most common errors, and celebrate when I make an improvement to a common error.

Every time I get these emails, I'm _more_ motivated to keep writing and improving. How cool would it be if we could harness that feeling on our teams to keep devs motivated and improving too.

I'm hoping to do a follow-up to this post after trying out some of these ideas on my own team. Stay tuned for an update!

Until then, look out for opportunities to celebrate small and big moments on your development teams. They are there; you just have to pay attention.

Happy coding!
