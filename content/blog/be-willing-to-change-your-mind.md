I was listening to a podcast not too long ago. The guest on the show was an author who had recently unpublished a book of theirs citing it has caused more damage than good. They had come to realize their stance on an issue was wrong.

The host said something I found profound. "You changed your mind!" she exclaimed. "Do you know how rare that is today?"

It's true. As humans, We often are unwilling to change our minds on a lot of things. We get entrenched in our opinions often without being open or willing to listen to another perspective.

Unfortnately, software engineers are probably some of the least likely people to change their minds. I've been one of them. We've been taught to think so critically and deeply about complex ideas that once we come to our conclusions it is hard to shift them.

However, growth and learning is often predicated on being willing to change - or at least morph - our understanding of the world. If we aren't willing to change and challenge our current mental models, we will never learn.

### Why Don't We Change Our Minds?

If changing our minds is foundational to learning and growth, we are we so resistent to it? I think there are a few reasons.

First, I think engineers have been told to not do so. Our industry has long touted the phrase "strong opinions loosely held" which has enforced the need for engineers to _create_ a strong opinion - even on things they don't care about. It sounds good at first, but really becomes a way for engineers with the strongest opinions to win regardless of if the opinion was actually good.

Second, changing our mind often feels like admitting were aren't good enough. Putting our own idea down to prefer someone else's idea feels embarrasing somehow. We start to think can't cut it as an engineer. It's imposter syndrome all over again.

Last, I thinkwe afraid of what changing our mind says about our strength or leadership. We are afraid that if we admit we were wrong about something that we are a bad leader. Or perhaps we fall prey to the sunk cost fallacy touting that "we've already come this far." Leaders are often more willing to ruin their culture and credibility rather than admit they were wrong about something and course correct.

These are legitimate concerns to be fair. It isn't easy to admit being wrong or to be willing to take a fresh perspective on something. To learn, though, we have to be willing to do so.

### Toolboxes vs. Multi-tools

One way I've become more willing to change my mind is by focusing on collecting tools for my toolbox rather than trying to find the perfect multi-tool.

In a toolbox there are many different tools each with unique capabilities. Almost everytime I've need to build something (outside of an Ikea shelf), I need a handful of those tools. If I was missing just one of those tools, I wouldn't be able to finish the task. 

The same is true for writing software. Knowing different langauges, patterns, and even processes will allow teams to find the right solutions for their problems. 

For a long time, however, I was focused on trying to find the perfect multi-tool. I thought if I could just find the multi-tools with a sharp enough knife and a strong enoug screwdriver/bottle-opener that I would have all the tools I need.

The problem was I kept coming up short with every multi-tool I bought. And because I had spent soo much time and so much effort picking the "perfect multi-tool" I was much more zealous about defending it when I didn't need to.

By building a toolbox, I'm more willing to put down a tool that isn't working in favor for another one. I'm also much more willing to replace or supliment my existing tools with new ones rather than having to find a new perfect to tool to replace my whole toolbox.

### Good, Better, and Best

Another helpful way I've been rethinking how and when to change my mind is remembering that not everything is right or wrong. Some decisions are more like a spectrum of good, better, and best.

This is especially true in softwar engineer. We often have an array of options to choose from when faced with a problem. The solutions we come up with are rarely completely wrong, but there will definitely be better and best options that we need to choose from. 

If we approach these decisions with a mindset of right vs. wrong we are likely to miss the best solution anyway. We'll be so focused on defending our idea that we won't listen to other solutions - even when they are extensions of our own idea!

This happenned to me not too long ago. I had spent a lot of time thinking about a solution to a problem and I was positive it was going to work really well. During a design session, one of my teammates threw out an idea that was pretty aligned with what I had thought about already, but I was so convinced I was _right_ that I didn't really pay attention. It wasn't until the next day that I realized "oh that is a much better idea!" :facepalm:

We don't have change our minds on everything either. That isn't the point of this article. 

The point is we need to be _willing_ to. We need to be introspective and humble enough to question our conclusions and opinions. We need to let go of bravado and be willing to come to the table admitting we were wrong about something. It takes strength to do those things.

But we won't reach our full potential until we do.
