description: Using an SSG as a Backend Engineer
---
### I'm a backend engineer. 

I don't tend to use the same technologies that everyone talks about on the Twitterverse or in the Dev.to community. It's not because I don't want to. Honestly, I'm a little embarrassed that I don't know it very well. The world of Javascript/Typescript moves **sooo** fast and if you blink you are out of the loop.

But I wanted to learn a little and I had a motivation to change my personal website since it was getting crufty. 

I had already dabbled a little with MDX after Kent C Doods posted about using Netlify and MDX for some of his presentations. 

I gave that a try and LOVED creating my presentation on Offheap Bloom Filters using it! I figured I would see how it would work for my website. 

Here is how I went about it.
