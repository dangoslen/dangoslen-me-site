The pairing session was not going great. We were trying to get to the bottom of a tricky bug but finding no luck. It was frustrating to feel like we weren't making progress.

But the really frustrating thing for me wasn't the lack of progress. It was the reason why we weren't making progress.

During my turn as the observer, I realized that my colleague could barely get their code to run locally. They hadn't setup any debugging tools (in their IDE or otherwise), were fighting with a swirling mess of Docker containers, and had no less than four terminal windows open all spewing text.

The reason we couldn't make progress was this: we couldn't easily run and debug the application in isolation.

Today I want to talk about how to apply the idea of [Kaizen]() to continous improvement of your local developer experience. I don't have a new path or technique to unveil to show you (there are plenty of those techniques to go around already). Instead I want to (hopefully) communicate why it is so crucial to make the improvement of daily work the most important work.

## The Most Important Work

When I first read The Phoenix Project, I couldn't put it down. I think I read the whole book is less than a week (which is fast for a slow reader like myself). There was something so relatable about the characters and the setting. It was relatable, in fact, some parts were painful.

When I picked up The Unicorn Project, I had a similair but even more visceral reaction. Gene had somehow found a way to describe every pain point I had experienced in my development career! I read along and cheered (I think out loud) as Maxine navigating the complexities of code and political land mines with persistence and skill.

Both of these books helped shape my views on organization structure, experimentation, and many other things. But the most important thing it shaped was what the most important work as a developer is: improving daily work.

Gene's Three Ways and Five Ideals explain much of this better than I will, but my summary is this: any improvement made to contributing code safely and easily to a team's codebase will have compounding effects over time. 

i.e. - if you make a 5% improvement to your ability to contribute code today, your whole team will experience that 5% improvement tomorrow. And that 5% improvement makes it easier to make the next big improvement in developer experience next week. 

Whether the improvement is paying down [technical debt]() or automating environment setup via `make` or Ansible scripts, the benefits will compound and lead to an unstoppable developer experience.
