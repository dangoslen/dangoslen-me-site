A foundational component to Agile (whatever flavor of it you like) is [daily improvement](https://dangoslen.me/blog/how-to-introduce-kaizen-to-your-team/). Teams need to be improving their code, tools, and even process to become a better and better team.

But when exactly does a team talk about _how_ they should be improving? Enter the retrospective.

Retrospectives are some of the most neglected meetings in the software industry. I remember bringing a retrospective meeting to my team many years ago. The participation in the meeting was certainly obligatory and not ethuastic. "We don't follow Scrum!" said one engineer. 

And while that engineer was correct - retros originate from the Scrum guide - the value of a retrospective can be found on teams working in _any_ iterative development cycle. 

But it takes some effort and some experimenting. Today I want to walk you through what a retro is, a few high-level formats for a good retro, and my top tip for making your retros effective.

## What is a Retro?

A retro is simply time for the team to gather, reflect on their work over the past iteration, and discuss ways to improve. The Scrum guide puts it this way:

> The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness. [...] The Scrum Team identifies the most helpful changes to improve its effectiveness. The most impactful improvements are addressed as soon as possible.

But before getting hung too much on Scrum and Sprint, pay attention to the core idea of the retro. The team is asking "How can we plan to increase our quality? How can we build a more effective process? How can we get better?" Regardless of how your team delivers work, this is a useful exercise.

To help break out of "sprint" thinking, think more about an iteration. How does your team break up work so that you can develop iteratively? Whatever way you segement that work (a time interval, release cadences, actual Sprints), the end of that iteration is a good time for a retro.

For example, the team I brought retros to that I mentioned earlier had a monthly release cycle. It made sense for us to use that cadence for our retro. We would wait until after the release had gone out and then reflect on how that release had gone.

The only caution is if your iteration is a time interval and that interval is long. Anything longer than a quarter is too long. You won't be able to course correct if you don't get feedback fast enough. Even [one degree off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_in_60_rule) can take you far from your planned destination.

One caveat around time intervals: I've found that retros for short time windows (a week) often repeat themselves as the team hasn't had enough time to actually make actions towards improvements or they haven't had enough time for those actions to make a meaningful difference. This is especially true for process oriented changes. Declaring "Lets tag work items this way from now on" and then revisiting that the next week will likely have a very small sample size to determine if it is working.

## How To Run One?

Now that we've defined that goals of a retro, how does one go about running one?

Like running any good meeting, running a retros is just as much about the prep work ahead of time than the actual meeting. If you've heard the phrase "A meeting worth having is a meeting worth having an agenda," retros go the same way.

Here are few tips to prepare for the retro.

### Pick a Format

Retros come in many shapes and sizes. The differences are often in the questions they ask the team to answer. Some retros focus on tracking employee engagement through sentiment or energy questions. Others might focus on tactical questions ("Did we hit our goals? Why not?").

One format I've always turned to time and time again is 4 "what" questions.

* What went well?

  Is the team hitting their delivery goals? Are they collaborating effectively? Are they hitting their SLOs?

* What went poorly?

  Is there a bug plaguing the team? Is there a bottleneck in their process? Was something paritcually confusing or frustrating?

* What did we lack?

  Is there a tool that could have helped the team do better? Are they knowledge gaps they need to close? 

* What can we do?

  After asking the earlier questions, focus on actions items the team could take. It might mean purchasing a tool. It might mean experimenting with a process. It could even be as simply as making an attempt to communicate on Slack or to improve documentation. 

Once you decide on a format, create a document in whatever online collaboration tool your team uses (Google Docs, Trello, Lucidchart, etc.). Group the document into sections under the questions you choose to use. 

A day or so before the retro, send the document out asking the team to provide their answers before the meeting. You'll be surprised how having done this little bit of async work will lead to better discussion and time allocation in the meeting.

### Divide the Time

Speaking of time, a critical component to running a good retro is using the time wisely. Your retro needs a good agenda to help keep the meeting flowing without going over.

A good method for this is running the retro in a [Lean Coffee]() format. In this format, everyone brings their ideas to the meeting and follows a lightweight process to determine what the group should discuss. The agenda is focused purely on the allocation of time and the activity during that time of time rather than the actual content.

Here is a brief guide on how to run a retro like a Lean Coffee meeting:

* Give time for members to add their answers to the questions

  Start out the meeting with 5-10 minutes of silent time for the team to add any remaining answers to the questions. If you use a tool that has a timer component built-in, definitely use it. It can be easy to 

* Vote for the top items

  Once all answers or items are in, conduct a quick "voting round." Give the team 2-5 minutes (depending on team size and the number of items) to scan over the items from each other and vote on what they would like to discuss. If you use a tool that has voting built-in great! If not, adding comments or even "[+1]" at the end of a Google Doc can work well too. 

  Don't give infinite votes either. I've found 3-4 votes per team member a good size for a 4-5 person team. Any more and too many items will have high votes you are back to where you started; any less and no item every gets more than 1 vote.

* Discuss the top items

  For the top 2-3 items in each group, spend about 5 minutes in discussion. Ask the team member who added the answer to expand on their answer if possible. See if the rest of the team agrees or disagrees. 
  
  Take summary notes of the discussion as a comment of sub-bullet under the answer. Don't be too detailed; a high-level understanding of extra context is all to look for. 
  
  If the team begins to talk about actions to take, write them down in the discussion notes too. Be careful, though, to keep the entire discussion from focusing on solutioning as those conversations can easily take up the rest of the time. 

  Like everything else, keep a timer if possible and try to keep things moving. You'll find that as you move through the retro that many items are intertwined: a positive of getting a feature out might also have a negative impact that the team felt overwhelmed. Getting a survey of the top "themes" across the items is the best prompt for your actions items.  

* Identify and assign action items

  

### A Few Notes On Facilitation

Be diligent on the time. Focus on where there is agreement over disagreement.

## My Top Takeaway

**Agree on one action item; actually do it**
