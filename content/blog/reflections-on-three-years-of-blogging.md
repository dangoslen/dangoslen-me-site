title: Reflections on Three Years of Blogging
description: Some thoughts about blogging, learning in public, and sharing what
  I've learned after three years of consistent(ish) blogging.
---
It was around three years ago that I decided I wanted to start blogging more consistently. I had written a few articles on Medium, but I didn't have any readers at the time. I was just writing into the void.

Since then I've published 50 articles on medium, moved my writing to my own domain built with Gatsby.js, and started cross-posting to dev.to. I haven't had the viral success that many bloggers talk about - I've got a lot to learn about SEO and good copy - but I have seen some success that makes me keep coming back.

Today, I wanted to share a few of those successes as well as a few failures on my part. I'll reflect on what has worked for me, what hasn't, and tell you about how this will shape my writing in the future.

## The Beginning

I started blogging because I had just joined a new team after having had a terrible experience on another. I was burnt out and tired. But I was also excited for this new role. 

As a joined, I realized I had something to offer on that team. Not just coding know-how or technical expertise. I had some insights on team culture from past experience being so terrible. I wanted to make my current team the best team I could by offering my experience of what not to do. I started thinking critically about what I could do to help build a great time and worked with the rest of my teammates to implement some of my ideas.

After a little while, I realized that my current team **was** becoming a great team after all. We weren't perfect, but it was a far cry from where I had been. The insights and ideas I had brought to the table were making an impact. 

Maybe others would like to hear this?

I started writing about the things our team was doing that were making us a better team. I wrote about \[code reviews] and why they matter, how [hasty abstractions](<>) can crush your team, and how\[great] user stories() have drive clarity. I also noticed that by writing, I was solidifying my own opinions and learning to express them better with each article.

## Gaining Readers

Like most bloggers, my first articles weren't getting read all that much. Part of this is a failing on my part (hint - I'm bad at marketing). The other part was that I wasn't writing **for** anyone. I was simply sharing my experience, but not writing about how you - the reader - would benefit from reading what I wrote.

In October 2019, though, I wrote an article about [simple code](<>) that started to gain real readers.

It wasn't a viral success, but it was enough to start to get my views into the thousands for the first time! 

I realized that maybe - just maybe - I something to offer. 

I decided that I needed to publish as quickly as possible. The name of the game, so I'm told, is publishing content all the time. I have some thoughts on this idea towards the end of this article though :)\

I published another article on my top 4 design patterns a week later. I got even more views! In fact, it is still my most successful article yet in terms of viewership - though I think I've written higher quality articles since. 

## Getting "Serious"

At this point (early November to late December) I was hooked on writing. I started reading resources on improving my content. I read some helpful books, signed up for a handful of blogging email courses, and created a content calendar. 

This is when I also started to experiment more and more with the topics of my writing. Why? Two primary reasons:
1) It can be hard to come up with unique content all the time. Sometimes falling back on sharing an experience or what you have learned (#todayilearned and #learninginpublic) is all you can do
2) I legitimally was curious to see if I could find patterns of what content I wrote connected with readers. Sadly, Medium is very narrow in this regard. You can tag your article with topics, but they are so broad it can be hard to tell what tagged stories are _actually_ about. I did find a few patterns that I will share at the end.

But I also started to feel - like a machine. I've come to dislike the term "content creator". Perhaps, I'm a creator. But not a creator of _content_. I like to position myself more as a creator of thought or systems. But this is all a bit tangential :)

## Getting Tired

After a few months of trying to keep a content calendar with a full-time job, going to master's school, and preparing for my wedding - I couldn't keep it up anymore. I was just too tired.

But additionally - I felt like my ideas had actually transformed into, well, _content_. I didn't feel like I was actually bringing unique perspectives or was able to able deep thought to a topic. I was doing what content creators have to do - find ways to write about something I knew, grab a reader's attention, hold it just long enough to read a brief article, rinse, and repeat. 

I'm not judging that approach. I think it's actually an extremely **demanding** regiment to follow. I simply have realized that I want to be at the bottom of things rather than on top of things as legend Donald Knuth puts it.
