title: Reflections on Three Years of Blogging
description: Some thoughts about blogging, learning in public, and sharing what
  I've learned after three years of consistent(ish) blogging.
---
It was around three years ago that I decided I wanted to start blogging more consistently. I had written a few articles on Medium, but I didn't have any readers at the time. I was just writing into the void.

Since then I've published 50 articles on medium, moved my writing to my own domain built with Gatsby.js, and started cross-posting to dev.to. I haven't had the viral success that many bloggers talk about - I've got a lot to learn about SEO and good copy - but I have seen some success that makes me keep coming back.

Today, I wanted to share a few of those successes as well as a few failures on my part. I'll reflect on what has worked for me, what hasn't, and tell you about how this will shape my writing in the future.

## The Beginning

I started blogging because I had just joined a new team after having had a terrible experience on another. I was burnt out and tired. But I was also excited for this new role. 

As a joined, I realized I had something to offer on that team. Not just coding know-how or technical expertise. I had some insights on team culture from past experience being so terrible. I wanted to make my current team the best team I could by offering my experience of what not to do. I started thinking critically about what I could do to help build a great time and worked with the rest of my teammates to implement some of my ideas.

After a little while, I realized that my current team **was** becoming a great team after all. We weren't perfect, but it was a far cry from where I had been. The insights and ideas I had brought to the table were making an impact. 

Maybe others would like to hear this?

I started writing about the things our team was doing that were making us a better team. I wrote about \[code reviews] and why they matter, how [hasty abstractions](<>) can crush your team, and how\[great] user stories() have drive clarity. I also noticed that by writing, I was solidifying my own opinions and learning to express them better with each article.

## Gaining Readers

Like most bloggers, my first articles weren't getting read all that much. Part of this is a failing on my part (hint - I'm bad at marketing). The other part was that I wasn't writing **for** anyone. I was simply sharing my experience, but not writing about how you - the reader - would benefit from reading what I wrote.

In October 2019, though, I wrote an article about [simple code](<>) that started to gain real readers.
