title: Why I Got My Masters Degree In Computer Science

  completely online (and for free!) why would I got back to school? "
---
I remember when I first told my team lead about possibly going back to school. He simply replied "You don't need it" and moved on. 

I then remember talking to people services at my company about what it would look like to get my degree part-time while working. They agreed to talk about it, but didn't seem to think I would actually follow through on anything. "Let us know when you get into a program and we can talk about it further."

When I did get accepted into a program, my manager gave me a baffled look. He was confused. "You are really going to go for this aren't you?" he said. 

While eventually all of these people came to support me, they had the same question many people have when I tell them I went back to school for a master's degree. Why would you do that?

I've given a few different answers over the years to various people at different times. What I want to do in this article is summarize why I got my masters degree, what I think it was worth it in the end, and hopefully help others considering if they should go back to school as well.

## Why?
This question always winds up being tough to answer. It's tough to answer well because I feel I need to provide a lot of context. I want to make sure I explain my situation since the decision for me to go back to school largely was based on many other factors.

Let's start with how I was introduced to software in the first place. 

## Teenage Coder and Undergraduate
I knew I wanted to be a software engineer since I was 12 when I first got introduced to coding via LEGO Mindstorms. I was writing C and Java before I could drive. By the time I got to college, I had this craving to understand computers as deeply as I possibly could.

I also m a genuily curious person. Like many software engineers, I just liked understanding how things worked. If I didn't know how something worked, I would break it apart trying to understand it; often not being able to put it back together.

These two components of having a deep drive to understand the world, and now a deep drive to understand computers in the same way, lead me to make a goal of getting my masters degree before I even started undergrad. 

As I was wrapping my undergraduate degree, though, I realized I needed a job. This was the case because 1) I was in debt and 2) I was tired. Like really tired. I just needed a break from the pace of academia. So I got a job thinking that I might one day go back to school, but it was more of a pipedream at that point. No one goes back to school when they don't _need_ to right?

## Career Engineer
After a few years of writing code, the itch to go back started to grow more noticeable. My brother was going to medical school, a few of my friends were getting their graduate degrees, and coding was starting to feel... routine. I wouldn't say I was bored perse. I just recognized that the majority of the problems I was solving were pretty close together. I was being challenged in some ways, but not in the deep, technical understanding of how computers worked. 

Around this time, I also started looking for other roles. As I browsed, I noticed that most of the roles I got excited about all mentioned a preference towards a higher degree. So I started doing some research. I took a look through my own company and others and realized that many of the people with roles I wanted also had some form of graduate degree too. This seemed interesting to me.

During this time I also learned another thing about myself and how I learn. I had signed up to take all of these online classes, but I never took them. I might start watching a lecture or two, but never finish. 

Why? I've come to learn that for me, I need rigourus structure. I need some skin in the game. I need something to keep me pushing through when the content got hard or I got distracted by some other new shiny course to take. 

Putting the pieces together, I recognized that I hadn't really fulfilled my desire to learn as much as I wanted. I wasn't growing in the way I wanted to in my work. And I recognized that the roles I wanted to move into were employing people with advanced degrees. It made sense. It was time to go back.

## But How
Once I decided I did, in fact, want to go back to school, I had a lot of other factors to figure out. Where would I go? How would I pay for it? Would I work at the same time? Would my girlfriend break up with me? Spoiler alert - we didn't break up and we have been married for almost a year now :)
