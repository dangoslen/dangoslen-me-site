title: Why I Got My Masters Degree In Computer Science
description: "In world where software development educations can happen
  completely online (and for free!) why would I got back to school? "
---
I remember when I first told my team lead about possibly going back to school. He simply replied "You don't need it" and moved on. 

I then remember talking to people services at my company about what it would look like to get my degree part-time while working. They agreed to talk about it, but didn't seem to think I would actually follow through on anything. "Let us know when you get into a program and we can talk about it further."

When I did get accepted into a program, my manager gave me a baffled look. He was confused. "You are really going to go for this aren't you?" he said. 

While eventually all of these people came to support me, they had the same question many people have when I tell them I went back to school for a master's degree. Why would you do that?

I've given a few different answers over the years to various people at different times. What I want to do in this article is summarize why I got my masters degree, what I think it was worth it in the end, and hopefully help others considering if they should go back to school as well.

## Why?
This question always winds up being tough to answer. It's tough to answer well because I feel I need to provide a lot of context. I want to make sure I explain my situation since the decision for me to go back to school largely was based on many other factors.

Let's start with how I was introduced to software in the first place. 

## Teenage Coder and Undergraduate
I knew I wanted to be a software engineer since I was 12 when I first got introduced to coding via LEGO Mindstorms. I was writing C and Java before I could drive. By the time I got to college, I had this craving to understand computers as deeply as I possibly could.

I also m a genuily curious person. Like many software engineers, I just liked understanding how things worked. If I didn't know how something worked, I would break it apart trying to understand it; often not being able to put it back together.

These two components of having a deep drive to understand the world, and now a deep drive to understand computers in the same way, lead me to make a goal of getting my masters degree before I even started undergrad. 

As I was wrapping my undergraduate degree, though, I realized I needed a job. This was the case because 1) I was in debt and 2) I was tired. Like really tired. I just needed a break from the pace of academia. So I got a job thinking that I might one day go back to school, but it was more of a pipedream at that point. No one goes back to school when they don't _need_ to right?

## Career Engineer
After a few years of writing code, the itch to go back started to grow more noticeable. My brother was going to medical school, a few of my friends were getting their graduate degrees, and coding was starting to feel... routine. I wouldn't say I was bored perse. I just recognized that the majority of the problems I was solving were pretty close together. I was being challenged in some ways, but not in the deep, technical understanding of how computers worked. 

Around this time, I also started looking for other roles. As I browsed, I noticed that most of the roles I got excited about all mentioned a preference towards a higher degree. So I started doing some research. I took a look through my own company and others and realized that many of the people with roles I wanted also had some form of graduate degree too. This seemed interesting to me.

During this time I also learned another thing about myself and how I learn. I had signed up to take all of these online classes, but I never took them. I might start watching a lecture or two, but never finish. 

Why? I've come to learn that for me, I need rigourus structure. I need some skin in the game. I need something to keep me pushing through when the content got hard or I got distracted by some other new shiny course to take. 

Putting the pieces together, I recognized that I hadn't really fulfilled my desire to learn as much as I wanted. I wasn't growing in the way I wanted to in my work. And I recognized that the roles I wanted to move into were employing people with advanced degrees. It made sense. It was time to go back.

## But How
Once I decided I did, in fact, want to go back to school, I had a lot of other factors to figure out. Where would I go? How would I pay for it? Would I work at the same time? Would my girlfriend break up with me? Spoiler alert - we didn't break up and we have been married for almost a year now :)

The first thing was to figure out where I would go. After a lot of research, I settled on three different programs: NC State University (local to me), Carnegie Mellon (a long shot) and Portland State University (where my girlfriend was at the time). They each had different cost structures as well, with NC State being the cheapest (because I was local) and the cost for Carnegie being the highest (out of state tuition and a prestigous program).

I then needed to prepare and take the Graduate Record Examinations or GRE. Man - that was a rough test. I would prepare nearly every morning from around 7:30 to 8:30 before work, and then usually a three to four hour strecth on Saturdays as well. I wound up having to take the test twice, but got scores I was happy with.

The most complex part to navigate through was conversations with my workplace. I had made a decision early on that getting a master's degree at the sacrifice of working experience would only be worth it at a prestigous program. It would need to be travel worthy essentially. But ideally, I wanted to work and go to school at the same time.

No this is the part I think most people struggle with my story on. Why would you want to do that? Put simply - money. I needed a job. Most student employment opportunities were for PhD candidates and that would have covered only the basics for living costs. I was gearing up to get married (my girlfriend had moved back to Raleigh shortly after taking the GRE), and would need something more than just covering the rent.

My plan then became simple: apply to the local program, and if I got in, I would talk to my workplace about how to make it work. If it became clear they were not interested in helping me figure it out, I would apply to my dream program at some other time. GRE scores are valid for five years, so I would just have that plan in my back pocket. 

## Getting Accepted and Setting Expectations
Thankfully, I got accepted to the local program. I then 

## So, Why Did I Get My Masters Again?
Yes, I know that quickly became a story. But I think it was important to show that I had a mix of motivations and circumstances that went it into my decision to get my masters degree. 

To summarize it briefly, I'll put it bulleted form.
 * I realized I wanted to know computers deeper than I was as a career software engineer
 * I realized I wanted to lead teams and as I looked round, I saw many leaders had advanced degrees
 * I was able to land in a unique situation that allowed me to earn my degree without sacrificing industry experience
 * I was able to get financial help from my company, allowing me to justify the cost of the degree

The next question, of course, is this: "was it worth it?". I'll answer that in another post soon, so if . you don't want to miss it, follow me on whatever platform you prefer. I'll make sure you know when its up :)

Happy coding!
