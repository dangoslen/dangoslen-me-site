title: Our Obsession With Patterns
description: "And why it might be too much. "
---
Learning patterns have become a core aspect for many people on their journey to becoming a software engineer. Articles and articles have been written about patterns and how to apply them. Courses, youtube videos, and GitHub repos all exist to help engineers master the power of patterns. I've even written an article myself.

As a senior engineer, however, I've started to wonder if we went in the wrong direction with patterns. 

The more code I write, the more I use the same patterns and the less I care about what those patterns are. And I certainly don't go attempting to use a pattern just because it is in a book or article. 

I think we are obsessed with software patterns. And I don't think we should be.

## The Wrong Direction
One of the reasons engineers have become obsessed with patterns is because patterns offer solutions. The idea goes "If I can learn every patterns, then I write any software and solve any problem". That thinking is kinda like "If I had everything in the world, then I would be happy."

Sadly, neither are true.

The reason is the direction is wrong. The best software engineers don't focus on existing solutions, they focus on solving new problems in the best way possible. The happiest people in the world aren't those that focus on wealth or money or possessions. The happiest people in the world are those that have immense clarity about what they love and they focus on that.

## Patterns Are Actually Really Limited
Patterns can provide incredible flexibility and evolvability within your codebase, but only if your codebase is of the right type. Object-oriented languages and statically-typed languages of course do well with patterns. Function programming and dynamicly-typed languages tend to not benefit as much. This is especially true for languages such as haskell, lisp or even prolog. 

I mention this because most engineers can program in more than one language and the type of language used on a project is based on the problem space. Yes, you could write a Java application to send a simple HTTP call to setup data for a test. Or you could write a bash script. Applying patterns in a bash script isn't the same as Java. And you don't _need_ a pattern anyhow to send a simple HTTP request.

If you learn patterns because you think knowing patterns will automatically help you write any software to solve any problem, it simply isn't true.
