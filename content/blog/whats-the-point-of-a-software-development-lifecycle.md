It's a Thursday morning. After logging into Slack, I see that there are several pull requests to review. And while I enjoy reviewing code, sometimes I'd rather write my own code. But since our team requires two reviews from team members before any code can get merged into the main branch, I realize I need to take a look at one of them that before starting on the rest of the daily tasks.

During standup later that day, we see a demo of a feature a few teammates have been working on. The demo is good overall, but one small detail starts a disussion: should the feature work this way or that? We come to an agreement and decide there is a little more coding to do before calling the work done.

Both of these micro-stories are examples of a software development lifecycle at work. If you have never heard of a software development lifecycle (SDLC), then you have come to the right post. We are talking all about the SDLC and the implications it has for the software teams develop.

Let's jump right in!

## What is a Software Development Lifecycle Anyway?

A software development lifecycle is simply a list of processes and tools that a team (or organization) follows in order to develop software products. Pretty simply right? 

I think the term lifecycle is extremely important to pay attention to. While software isn't a living thing, it exhibits many of charatersitics of a living thing: software grows and develops, responds to it's environment, consumes energy, and might even exhibit forms of homeostatis (load-shedding) and reproduction (scaling). 

It also means that, like any living thing, there might be parts of our software that is unhealthy or dying. Our software might be reaching end-of-life (a real term) and we might have different ways of monitoring/maintaining dying software than software actively growing. We also might have parts of our software that are unhelathy (bugs, performance issues) that we must tend to in certain ways to make sure we care for our software correctly.

Much like how a garden has a lifecycle based on the season, the lifecycles of plants within it, and the goals of the garde, so our software has a lifecycle too.

## A Guide for How to Build Software

At its most basic form, the SDLC is simply a guide for how to care for our software. These rules can be extremely specific, or extremely vague based on the scope of the lifecycle and the group that must comply with it. For example, a lifecycle might say "No developer should be able to write code and deploy it to production on their own." (more on why this might be a rule later). It could also say "Any bug found in production must be logged, categorized, and priotized within 24 hours."

Each development lifecycle policy will be different at each organization. At a high-level, they will likely address _at least_ the following questions?

* Which team does work go to? (roles and responsibilites)
* How does work get to a team? (entrance criteria, prioritization)
* How does the team complete the work brought to them? (methodolgy, where code is stored)
* How the team knows the work is finished? (definition of done)
* How the team releases finished work into production? (change control) 
* How does the team know the work is behaving as intended in production (observability and telemetry)
