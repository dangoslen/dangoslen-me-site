title: Version, Releases, and Deployments! Oh My!
description: Software is full of overloaded terms. Let's clarify what we mean by
  a few of them.

Like most complex work, the software industry is full of overloaded or ambigous terminology. Teams or companies can often create their own concepts of terms like service, or integration test, or even quality assurance to match how their teams work.

That is all well and fine as long as the teams agree on the definition and work hard to make sure that definition can be easily found. ie - new team members must be able to learn these new definitions (and challenge them too!) so that the team stays in sync.      

Sadly, this is really hard to do. Every person has a unique perspective based on their experience that they bring with them. Even with properly defined ideas, those ideas can still be misunderstood.

But there are a few concepts that I think get misunderstood too often. These ideas are versions, releases, and deployments. 

And they get misunderstood for a lot of the same reasons as other terms - every engineer has different experiences they bring to these ideas. 

However, I think many of these ideas get misunderstood because they get used too interchangably. Teams will use release one week and deploy another without realizing it. Tools will use version and release to refer to the same thing. GitHub uses the term releases but other tools uses versions.

No wonder we get confused!

I want to share with you my perspective on what these terms mean for software teams and when to best use them. Hint - it depends on what you are building! Let's dive in.
