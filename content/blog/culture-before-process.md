Engineers love to talk about process. 

Whether the process is about how to run a team, development process, or even deployments, we are always talking about the "right process." And it makes sense. A process is pretty similar to an algorithm and writing algorithms in the form of computer code is what many of us do _all day_.

Some engineer flat out _hate_ process; others seek to find the best process possible. Debates between Agile gurus about what even Agile _is_ seem endless let alone which flavor of Agile is best.

Engineers will also _blame_ the process (especially a [development process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process)) when a project or product starts to go awry. Many engineers can relate to late projects or chaotic projects due to a lack of process. "We never got clear requirements" or "Requirements change without us being notified" are common protests for when a project is late or rife with bugs. Some engineers will comment on priority, claiming it wasn't clear what work was to be prioritized within their team and a better process for prioritization is needed.

When projects like this finish (if they ever do), retrospectives often will have action items relating to "improving the process" to avoid the same chaos in the future. Teams might suggest trying a new method such as Scrum or Kanban while other teams might want to double-down on axioms of their existing process. Some teams might suggest _more_ meetings while others might desire less feeling that the team was too tied-up in meetings to get work done.

In any and all of these cases, scrutinzing the process is right and good.

But I think it's putting the cart before the horse.

## The Process is Rarely the Problem

In my experience, the process itself is rarely the problem. After having worked for a decade in the industry across small teams, large teams, cross-functional teams, etc. and across a few different companies, I can tell you each process has it's failure points and shortcomings. Whether it's the delivery methodology (Agile), the companies product requirements gathering process (or lack of it), or even the process of assigning work, they all will eventually hit some form of issue.

For example, I've seen Scrum cause teams to spend hours (literally) debating how to break up a story so it fits within the next sprint. The team knew what their capactity was, so they were stuck to either take on less work in the sprint OR take on _too much_ work in the sprint. Kinda silly since the work needs to get done either way.

I've also seen Kanban teams oblivious to their progress on a project. It can be easy to ignore all other work besides work in the "TODO" column. Small interrupts find their way into the TODO column and since there is not formal backlog refinement or estimation meetings, teams don't realize they've been off track for two or three weeks.

Product requirements is a good one too. I've seen twenty+ page requirements documents full of contradicting requirements that someone spent _lots_ of effort to write - and then see it thrown out the window in a thirty minute meeting. I've also seen a product requirements document that was less than a page long for an incredibly complex set of work. Both documents came out of the same process too :).
