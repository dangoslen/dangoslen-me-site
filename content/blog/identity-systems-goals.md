While wandering a streets on during New Years' Eve several years ago (pre-COVID) I came upon a tree. The tree was covered in small strips of paper tied to it with bits of twine or string. On each was a short phrase written in squiggly marker with phrases like "Get in shape", "Budget our money better", or "Stop drinking." Each was a resolution for the coming year.

I wondered: how many people gave more than 30 seconds of thought to their so-called resolution? Did they ever write it down somewhere else? 

Our culture loves the idea of a resolution and the whole idea of making changes in the New Year. But we all know the data: most resolutions don't work. Resolutions are often vague, unplanned, and done without any accountability structure - ingredients required for successful behavior change. If we really want to change our lives in the coming year, we need more than a resolution: we need actionable goals, and a system to put them in place.

A popular book on behavior change is the now famous _Atomic Habits_ by James Clear. A famous quote from the book is this

> You don't rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems

The idea is that in order to achieve goals, we have to do the work ahead of time to develop a system or a plan in which to accomplish it. If you want to go the gym more, you need to state which gym, what time, for how long, etc. You probably need to pick some form of workout plan. If you show up at the gym and have to create a plan on the spot, you are likely to be dis-engaged, do a short workout, see no results and ultimately quit. 

## Identity

But even deeper than the need for systems, and discussed in _Atomic Habits_, is the need for _identity_. When we start with external forces such as systems and goals, we divorce them from our internal motivation. We forget the why. We come up with goals that, even well-intentioned, can feel arbitrary or forced.

When we start from identity, however, we flip the whole thing on it's head. We start to think about the person we are _becoming_. We start to consider the (hard!) question of "who do I want to become?" "What do I want?"

The reason this is hard is because we often forget who we are. I know it sounds cliche, but it's true. We forget who we are, what we are doing, and where we want to go. 

We all have multiple identities too. We don't need to find one perfect moniker for who we are. We are engineers, activists, athletes, designers, enthusiasts, etc. But defining a few _core_ identities can help us understand ourselves better. From there, we can define goals and develop systems to help us reach those goals.

For example, I'm a climber. I love climbing and my love for it has only grown in the past few years. And what do climbers do? They climb. This year I want to climb consistently, and achieve a V7 boulder problem and a 5.11 route.

Another example might be someone considers themselves a software leader (whether that is as a tech lead, a Staff role, a distinguished role, or even as an open source maintainer). They might step back and wonder how they can further their identity as one. It might mean getting a new certification this upcoming year, learning a new language, or speaking at a conference. It could also be a goal to help someone on your team get promoted.

In either case, there is an _identity_ formed and a few _goals_ worth pursuing. But how do those goals get achieved? We need to create a _system_.

## Systems

Once we have defined an identity to reinforce and goals to help us do that, we need to create systems that help us achieve those goals. 

Systems are a fancy way to talk about an on-going plan. They often become a set of habits and schedules that dictate how and what we do.

Back to the climber example, I want to reinforce my identity as a climber by climbing regularly. I'd also like to be able to climb a V7 and a 5.11 (indoor) by the end of the year. These are my _goals_.

In order to reach those goals, I've set in my calendar that every Monday, Wednesday and Friday I go climbing at noon for an hour and a half. I've also set aside Saturday mornings to focus on top roping with a partner (since the middle of the day is not a common time of day to find climbing partners). I've also purchased a training book that I will incorporate into my schedule once it arrives. 

I'm also 100% confident my system will need to change; that's ok. The point isn't to get the system 100% right, it's to _have_ one and be willing to make tweaks as needed.

## Identity and Systems Continue Beyond the Goal

One of the other key ideas from _Atomic Habits_ and building systems is that building systems outlive goals. Goals are temporary by nature. Even long goals eventually are either accomplished, or it's realized they aren't possible anymore. What happens when either of these two events occur? If I can't reach my goal of climbing a V7 boulder this year, does that mean I'm not a climber? I wouldn't think so.

But by having a system, we can continue to reinforce our identity. Who we are and what we do isn't dictated by our achieving or not achieving certain goals, but by how we choose to live our lives everyday. It's about intentionally choosing how we spend our energy and time rather than mindlessly letting things pass by.

To be clear, it isn't easy to live this way. I myself still struggle to create the patterns and systems I want. But I know that I'm trying.

And remember, very few things worth doing are easy anyway.

Let's move away from resolutions and arbitrary goals. Let's discover who we are, who we want to be, and create the systems to help us get there. 

A good template I used in my own general was simply this

**Identity:** an identity I want to reinforce

**Why/What:** short paragraph about why I want to reinforce that identity and what things a person with that identity does

**Goals:** short goals for the year; 2-3

**System:** specify a (rough) plan for when/how I reinforce that identity and push for my goals

Happy coding! And a happy New Year!
