  tips to help you give feedback well.

I don't know about you, but there are times I want to pull my hair out. Stressed at a bug, my own stupiditity, or when I feel a situation is just escalating out of control.

Other times I have pulled my hair out are times when I tried to give feedback to a teammate and it was taken the wrong way. Or when I couldn't figure what to say to help them grow. Or when they simply wouldn't listen to the feedback I have given beforehand. I **was** the senior engineer right?! ðŸ™ƒ

While, I'm not an expert at all-things-feedback, I've grown a lot in the past several years in how I give feedback to people on my team. From both technical aspects to soft skills and professionalism. 

I want to share some of the tools I have learned to help you give better feedback. Whether you are a senior engineer who just got promoted, a junior struggling to give any feedback at all, or someone who finds it hard to articulate what you think is helpful, these are for you.
