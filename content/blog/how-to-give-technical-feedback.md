  tips to help you give feedback well.

Let's face it: giving feedback is hard. 

You want to tell that colleague of yours how they could be better. You want to tell your manager that it feels like they don't listen when you share an idea. You want to share a piece of technical insight to help them code better.

But how do you do that without sounding like a jerk? Or like you are just complaining? How do you help your team by pointing out areas for improvement (because you are - of course - the expert on everything... ðŸ™ƒ)

While, I'm not an expert at all-things-feedback, I've grown a lot in the past several years in how I give feedback to those I work with. From both technical aspects to soft skills and professionalism. 

I want to share some of the tools I have learned to help you give better feedback. Whether you are a senior engineer who just got promoted, a junior struggling to give any feedback at all, or someone who finds it hard to articulate what you think is helpful, these are for you.


## Start With a Question
There is a simple question that I have found helps in nearly EVERY time I give feedback to someone.

> Can I give you some feedback?

It sounds so simple, right? And it is! But it's actually harder than you might think. It is very easy to react to someone constantly being late and telling them it is frustrating that they are late to meetings all the time. Without even knowing, you might mention to someone that they could have solved a problem faster if they tried a different approach.

In both of these cases, you have given unwanted feedback. It is likely they aren't ready to receive it! Unwanted feedback is much more like telling someone what to do than giving feedback. 

If they say "not right now" or "no", then give them the space they need. And don't worry if they always say "no". If they _never_ are willing to recieve feedback, this will never grow and that is honestly their problem. All you can do is be willing to give thoughtful, honest, and humble feedback when they are willing to receive it.

So what happens when they say "yes"? Keep reading!

## State an Objective Observation
Now that they are willing to receive feedback, you need to make sure your feedback is rooted in objective observations. In the scenario of a co-worker being constnatly late to meetings, the objective observation is that they are frequently late to meetings. That is it. 

We need to avoid making knee-jerk conclusions like:

* They are **always** late to **every** meeting.
* They don't respect other people's time.
* They aren't committed to the team's success

The worst thing you can do when giving feedback is to make such large conclusions and assumptions.

Instead, simply tell them what you have noticed. Stick to the facts. A good approach might be to say "Hey Todd, I've noticed that you have been showing up to meetings a little late recently.

## Giving Feedback Takes Practice
Just like coding, there isn't a magic formulea that will solve all your problems. Sure there are [patterns] and frameworks (just like in code) that can help you, but you have to actually give feedback to get better at it.

But where do you start? How to you start giving feedback without damaging a relationship or hurting your career?

## Start with yourself!  

You need to learn to give feedback to yourself. When you give yourself feedback, you will start to understand what phrases, tools, patterns, etc. help you or hurt you. There is a good chance that what is helpful to you will by helpful to someone else. The same goes for feedback that made you more frustrated or 

Happy coding!
