# Knowing Your Audience

One of my favorite quotes from The Pragmatic Programmer has nothing to do with programming. It has to do with communication. They write:

> if you can't 

Communication is, in many ways, the crux of the software engineer. Software is a tough thing to grasp and communicating our ideas about software is even harder. It's a complex task and it's why we've built up vocabulary around [patterns]() and archtiecture.

Another aspect of communication as an engineer isn't what the idea is or how you present it, but who you are presenting it to. It is rare that you can present an idea to your product owner in the same way as you do to your teammates or even your manager. And almost certianly not the CTO.

I'm still learning how to present my ideas well (this blog being an example of my learning journey ðŸ˜‚), but I want to tell you how I try to think about how to think through presenting my ideas to various audiences.

In general I think of three axes that can help you tailor your presentations to match the audience.

## Technical Experience

This is the axis many engineers think of first. "Is my audience technical like me or not?" This is a great question to consider.

The more technically similiar is to you, the more you can get away with using the jargon of your skillsets. Engineers know about garbage collection. They understand if you said "Are garbage collections are taking too long somtimes leading to our service being unavailable." On the other hand, mention garbage collection to a marketer and they might picture a literal garbage truck. 

The further away from technical skills your audience becomes, the more you need to encapsulate (a technical term I know!) those technical details. The marketer from earlier trying to promote your product might not understand garbage collection, but they will know that in the market customers want reliable services. So any idea you have to reduce garbage collection times to increase reliability really should be discussed as an idea to increase reliability. Same for a product owner.

It isn't always possible to hide all of the technical details. Sometimes the  details around a tricky bug or outage need to be discussed. In these cases, do your best to explain those details at a highlevel without talking about specific code paths or services, etc. The less you can discuss the nitty gritty and discuss product implications or business outcomes the better. Do you 

It is also important to note here that even within your eng. organization that there is a vast range of experience and knowledge. Even if you are presenting an idea to other engineers, they might have never heard of a particular pattern, concept, or strategy before. Be prepared to explain them breifly if asked. Avoid the dangerous assumption that "every engineer knows that."


## Role

## Team Proximity

The last axis to consider is team proximity. 

No one understands the issues and needs of your team builds better than it's members. This means that in the same way you can get away with talking about specifics of your teams day-to-day when talking with your team. 

But outside of your team, you have to provide context for what matters and what doesn't. Even with your eng. orgnization, your team might be dealing with a data model that hinders your team that is hard to explain to other teams. If you state that the data model is a problem, the next question is likely to be "what about the data model is hindering you?" or "how much is it hindering you?" As you move further from you immediate teammates, you will need to provide answers to such questions. 

But the answers aren't easy. You have to take into account the previous axes of technical experience and role, twhat the meeting is about (a product brief, a working group, quarter review with eng. leadership, etc.). You need to find the balance between too much or too little information. And it's hard to do.

A good rule of thumb for these answers is to go back to talking about high level implications and business outcomes rather than nitty-gritty. Even when explaining a technical condurum to another team (like the data model), focus on what the _effects_ are of the problem on your team. Or explain what the _benefits_ are (or will be) of a new idea or iniatiave.

Ideally you anticipate these questions so you can put them into your presentation materials. This gives you extra tine to consider all of the factors invovled. You can tweak and refine your wording, order, and details several times.

## Conclusion

**Talk about value**


As a software engineer, it's important to not only understand your external audience, but also your internal audience. When presenting ideas or giving presentations to your colleagues or higher-ups, it's crucial to know who you're speaking to and how to effectively communicate your message to them. That's why software engineers need to be mindful of their internal audience.

Knowing your internal audience means understanding who they are, what their roles are, and what their level of technical expertise is. This will allow you to tailor your presentation to their needs and make sure that your message is heard and understood.

One of the biggest mistakes that software engineers can make when presenting to their internal audience is assuming that everyone has the same level of technical knowledge. It's important to remember that not everyone in the room will have the same technical expertise, and it's up to you to make sure that your message is accessible to everyone.

To do this, it's important to use language and terminology that is understandable to everyone in the room. Avoid technical jargon and acronyms unless you're sure that everyone in the room will understand them. If you do need to use technical terms, be sure to define them clearly and provide context so that everyone can follow along.

Another important aspect of knowing your internal audience is understanding their roles and responsibilities. When presenting ideas or giving presentations, it's important to tailor your message to the specific needs of each individual or team. For example, if you're presenting to a group of project managers, you'll want to focus on how your ideas or software will impact project timelines and budgets.

In addition to understanding your internal audience, it's also important to be prepared and organized when presenting your ideas or software. Make sure that your presentation is well-structured and that you have all the necessary information and data to support your message. Practice your presentation beforehand so that you're comfortable and confident when speaking to your internal audience.

In conclusion, knowing your internal audience is just as important as knowing your external audience. By understanding who you're speaking to and tailoring your message to their needs, you can effectively communicate your ideas and software to your colleagues and higher-ups. Remember to use clear language and provide context when using technical terms, and be prepared and organized when presenting your message.
