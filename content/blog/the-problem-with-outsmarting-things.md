We all have that one friend. That friend that when faced with a new game or situation will try to be a little too smart for their own good. 

Instead of trying to learn and understand whatever they are presented with, they try to outsmart it. From the first moment, they are trying to find a loophole in the rules. They are trying to find the trick that will ultimately allow them to out-manuver the rest of the competition.

I saw this happen first hand a few weeks ago. I was playing a social deception game in which players are trying to convince the rest of the players who are "good" and who are "bad." This player was sure that after all of two previous rounds of gameplay that they had found a loophole in the game. They acted on this "insight" without a lot of thought and ultimately gave away who a key player was in the game. Giving this away immedateily meant the game was lost for their team. 

I sat and shook my head. 

As I reflected on what happenned in that game, I've come to realize I don't ever want to try outsmarting things. It isn't a good idea or approach to life. Here is why.

## No One Is Smarter Than Everyone

When someone approachs a situation trying to outsmart the competition, they are making a dangerous assumption: they know something that no one else knows. They have some unique ability or intelligence that no one in the room has. 

While there are situations where that will be true, assuming that is pretty audcious. How many times has somone walked into a room full of people and know more than each individual person there? Pretty rare.

Take this to the next level then: how many people are individually smarter or more capable than entire teams? If you work in any moderatly successful organization, there is very little chance that the one person is left to make all the decisions. Yes, their might be final decision-makers - and their should be. But the world's best leaders practice delegation since they know that their collective team can - and will - make better decisions than if they made every decision themselves. 

Imagine how it would go if the best leader you know got up one day and said "I'm smarter than each of you. And I'm smarter than all of you combined." I doubt you would respond well. And worse - they would most certainly be wrong.

Going back to the game from earlier, this friend made was making the claim "not only am I smarter than the rest of the players here - I'm smarter than the rule makers of this game too". While I don't think that was exactly what ran through his head, somewhere that thought did exist. There was pride.

_If it sounds like I'm beating up on this friend that isn't the goal. In fact, I've done this exact same thing many - many - times. I have pride too. The situtation is that happenned with this game was just the perfect example for this post_

## Competition Isn't Evertyhing

Trying to outsmart people also brings along another assumption: that everything is a compeition to win. That everyone are compeition to beat and claim victory over. 

What a sad way to live!

Now of course there are games with winners and losers. In fact, that is sometimes what makes those games fun in the first place. But for the most part, life is not a zero-sum game. Success doesn't have to be at the expense of others.

> Success != victory over someone or something. 


## Getting Smarter > Outsmarting

The biggest issue with trying to outsmart people or things though is the opportunity cost. Instead of trying to find the loophole or the uncover the "trick" the outsmart everything - focus on getting smarter!

Focus on learning. Learn the rules. Understand how the mechanics of a game work. Gain a deep understanding of the long-term strategies to gain success.
