## The Gatekeeper

The Gatekeeper is the code reviewer most people are afraid of. They _must_ review every line of code. The are involved in every code review without being requested. No one's code get's merged unless they approve.

## The Rubber-Stamper

The Rubber-Stamper is the developer who simply doesn't care. They don't care about quality, correctness, or understanding the code base. For the most part, they just want to clock-in, clock-out, and coast. You won't get helpful feedback from them.

## The Nervous

The Nervous reviewer is just that: nervous about providing feedback. Often these reviewers are either brand new developers, or have never been asked to review code before. 

If you feel like you are The Nervous reviewer, I'm writing a book just for you!

## The Sloth

The Sloth is the reviewer who takes too long. You have to remind them to review your code frequently and they can sometimes struggle to make up their mind. Sloth reviewers usually overlap with Nervous or Idealist reviewers.

## The Speedster

Opposite of the Sloth, the Speedster reviews code promptly and quickly. But they often miss critical issues are lack thoroughness. Speedster reviewers tend to slow down the review process the most as they often divide their feedback across multiple reviews or are so vague in their feedback that it requires back-and-forth to understand properly.

## The Idealist

The Idealist is the reviewer who is never finished. Not because they are lazy (Sloth) or they are afraid (Nervous) but because they want to find the _best_ solution possible. While finding the best solution is an admirable trait, they often can't delineate best best and good enough solutions. Often the Idealist is a newly minted senior engineer who is thinking deeply about where the code needs to go, but not willing to make appropriate concessions in the moment.

## The Reviewer You Want

The reviewer you want is the reviewer who can walk the razor-thin path between all of these types.

* They take their time reviewing code, but not too long. They provide feedback promptly.
* They provide feedback with clarity. They cite articles and documentation for their feedback.
* They are willing to make trade-offs when needed, but also hold fast to principles when required.
* They take into consideration the author, business context, and timeliness when providing feedback. They understand a junior engineer will need more mentorship and direction, while a senior engineer might just need to be reminded of a pertinent detail.
