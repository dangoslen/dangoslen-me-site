I've spent 10 years as a professional software engineer. I've worked with some large teams, small teams, and in between. I've worked with really effective high-performing engineers, and other engineers that were difficult to say the least.

After my limited experience, I've learned a handful of critical things that seem to hold true not matter what team, product, or even organization I'm working in.

These are my Top 10 Rules for Building a Software as a Team.

# 1 - The team is the primary unit for delivering work

# 2 - Teams should be designed to deliver value with minimum dependency on other teams

# 3 - All team members should be famailiar and comfortable enough with code owned by the team so they can contribute to it

# 4 - All team members should be able to contribute to the code owned by the team safely, securly, and quickly

# 5 - Teams should have dedicated times for learning and experimentation

# 6 - Teams should work to improve daily work for both themselves and teams that use their software

# 7 - Teams should have clear signals and telemtry to understand how their code is behaving and performing in any environment

# 8 - Teams should have defined actions steps to take in the event of failures or degraded performance in order to minimize time to recovery

# 9 - Teams and product owners must agree on goals and delivery dates that both satisfy business goals and maintain a sustainable pace

# 10 - Teams should publish and maintain documentation for how other teams should interact with them and with their software
